    <h4>Congratulations! Based upon your interests and who you are, the following portfolio has been created and tailored for you. 
        Of course, as this is yours, not all equities have been picked as some we would like to leave up to you! The rule is simple: Each equity is given a percentage weight, analogous to a slice of pie. 
    Your complete portfolio is 100% and we leave it up to you to decide the fraction of that 100% percent you would like each equity to be.
    <br><br> Toggle the buttons for more information on equity before deciding. Your complete portfolio should be made up of 3 to 5 equities, and 2 equities have already been chosen for you.
    <br> Choose well, and we'll catch you on the next pane.</h4><br /><br />
